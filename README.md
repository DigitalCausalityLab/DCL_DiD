This project is part of the Digital Causality Lab from the ISA-Zentrum at Hamburg University. In this project, we describe how a Differences-in-Differences-Design works theoretically and illustrate this with example data. 
This porject is useful for anyone, who wants to understand how a DiD-Design works. We also draw attention to the assumptions and limitations of a DiD-Design. This project is for you, if you want to get a 
broad intuition about causality and DiD. 

Download the dataset testdata and save it together with the R script in one folder. This notebook will walk you through the code and gives background information on the kex concepts of a DiD: INSERT NOTEBOOK
